# Ring-Data-JSON

Standard Ring middleware functions for handling JSON requests and
responses -- using
[org.clojure/data.json](https://github.com/clojure/data.json),
rather than Cheshire.

Cheshire is a great library but it depends on Jackson for JSON
encoding and decoding which can lead to "dependency hell" and is also
so widely-used that it is often targeted by malicious actors and that
leads to security concerns. `org.clojure/data.json` is a pure Clojure
JSON library that has no dependencies and is "fast enough" for most
use cases.

This library uses the `ring.middleware.data-json` namespace to
distinguish it from the original `ring.middleware.json` namespace
in Ring's [ring-json](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-json)
middleware, but is otherwise intended to be a drop-in replacement
for that library.

## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:

    [com.github.seancorfield/ring-data-json "0.5.2"]

or to your `deps.edn` file's `:deps`:

    com.github.seancorfield/ring-data-json {:mvn/version "0.5.2"}

## Usage

#### wrap-json-response

The `wrap-json-response` middleware will convert any response with a
collection as a body (e.g. map, vector, set, seq, etc) into JSON:

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.data-json :refer [wrap-json-response]]
         '[ring.util.response :refer [response]])

(defn handler [request]
  (response {:foo "bar"}))

(def app
  (wrap-json-response handler))
```


#### wrap-json-body

The `wrap-json-body` middleware will parse the body of any request
with a JSON content-type into a Clojure data structure, and assign it
to the `:body` key.

This is the preferred way of handling JSON requests.

```clojure
(use '[ring.middleware.data-json :only [wrap-json-body]]
     '[ring.util.response :only [response]])

(defn handler [request]
  (prn (get-in request [:body "user"]))
  (response "Uploaded user."))

(def app
  (wrap-json-body handler {:keywords? true :bigdecimals? true}))
```


#### wrap-json-params

The `wrap-json-params` middleware is an alternative to
`wrap-json-body` for when it's convenient to treat a JSON request as a
map of parameters. Rather than replace the `:body` key, the parsed
data structure will be assigned to the `:json-params`. The parameters
will also be merged into the standard `:params` map.

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.data-json :refer [wrap-json-params]]
         '[ring.util.response :refer [response]])

(defn handler [request]
  (prn (get-in request [:params "user"]))
  (response "Uploaded user."))

(def app
  (wrap-json-params handler))
```

Note that Ring parameter maps use strings for keys. For consistency,
this means that `wrap-json-params` does not have a `:keywords?`
option. Instead, use the standard Ring `wrap-keyword-params` function:

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.keyword-params :refer [wrap-keyword-params]])

(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-keyword-params
      wrap-json-params))
```

### Differences from Ring-JSON

Although this is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Ring-JSON,
there are inevitably going to be some corner case differences. Those
will be documented here as they are discovered.

#### Options

The following options are supported for compatibility:

* `:bigdecimals?` -- can be set to `true` to return floating point numbers as `BigDecimal`; the equivalent `data.json` option is `:bigdec true`.
* `:escape-non-ascii` -- can be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable escaping of non-ASCII characters in the output; *the default for Ring-JSON is `false` but the default for Ring-Data-JSON is `true`*; the underlying `data.json` option is `:escape-unicode`.
* `:key-fn` -- this is the same for both libraries (and it is asymmetric between response and params/body).
* `:keywords?` -- can be set to `true` to convert keys in maps to keywords; the equivalent `data.json` option is `:key-fn keyword` (which can also be used by both libraries).
* `:pretty` -- can be set to `true` to pretty-print the JSON output; the equivalent `data.json` option is `:indent true` and there are some slight formatting differences (e.g., no space before the colon in maps).

Ring-Data-JSON does not support Cheshire-specific options beyond these,
but it supports all the options that `data.json` supports.

In particular, for Ring-JSON, you could specify `:date-format` as
as format string for `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` to control how dates
were formatted in the output. Ring-Data-JSON instead uses the
`:date-formatter` option which should be
a `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` instance.

#### Date/Time Formatting

As noted above, Ring-Data-JSON uses `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`
and coerces date/time values to `java.time.Instant` before formatting.

Since Ring-JSON uses `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` and older date/time
types, there are some differences in which formats are supported.

> Note: discussion is ongoing about enhancing `data.json`'s date/time formatting support that may make this difference moot.

#### Supported Clojure Versions

Ring-JSON still supports Clojure 1.7.0. Ring-Data-JSON requires
at least Clojure 1.8.0.
